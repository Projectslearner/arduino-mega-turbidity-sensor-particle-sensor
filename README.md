# Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor project showcases how to interface a turbidity sensor with an Arduino Mega to measure water clarity based on suspended particle levels. Turbidity sensors are crucial in environmental monitoring and water quality assessments.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **Turbidity Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Turbidity Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Analog Pin (turbidityPin):** Connected to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **GND Pin:** Connected to the ground (GND) on the Arduino Mega.
   - **+5V Pin:** Connected to the 5V power supply on the Arduino Mega.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the turbidity sensor readings displayed in the Serial Monitor.
   - Dip the turbidity sensor into water to measure changes in turbidity levels.

#### Applications
- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Measure turbidity levels in water bodies for environmental studies.
- **Aquarium Monitoring:** Monitor water clarity in aquariums for aquatic health.
- **Industrial Applications:** Assess particle levels in industrial process water for quality control.

#### Notes
- **Analog Readings:** Turbidity sensors provide analog voltage output proportional to turbidity levels.
- **Calibration:** Some turbidity sensors may require calibration for accurate readings in different environments.
- **Serial Output:** Utilize serial communication for real-time monitoring and data logging of turbidity measurements.
